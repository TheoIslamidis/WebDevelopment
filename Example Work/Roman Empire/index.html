    <h2>About the Roman Empire</h2>
    <p>The Roman Empire was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome. As a polity, it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. The city of Rome served as its capital until the empire's collapse in the 5th century AD.</p>
    <p>The civilization began as an Italic settlement in the Italian Peninsula, dating from the 8th century BC, that grew into the city of Rome and which subsequently gave its name to the empire over which it ruled and to the widespread civilisation the empire developed. The civilization was led and ruled by the Romans, alternately considered an ethnic group or a nationality.</p>
